# LIRI-bot

LIRI-bot is a command-line application using node.js to execute server-side JavaScript. 
One of the main node modules featured is Axios which is the server-side equivalent of
an AJAX call in front-end JS. With the **Axios**, LIRI-bot the user is able to give a request
and LIRI-bot returns a response.  

Axios allows for asynchronous processing of JavaScript in conjunction with other tasks or files
such as  **.gitignore** and **.env**. Aside from being able to retrieve information for the client, 
Axios can also protect sensitive information such as API Keys. LIRI-bot uses .gitignore and .env to
hide the API keys needed to provide a response to its user. The file .gitignore lets GitHub know 
what files should be ignored...or excluded from being visible or accesible to the average end-user 
without affecting the functionality of the application.
